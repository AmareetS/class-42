| Standard Game Design Elements | Game Design Elements for packman                             |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| playing character(pc)         | packman                                                      |
| Non Playing Character(npc)    | ghosts                                                       |
| Goal of the game              | The player has to control the packman to eat all the yellow dots spread across in the maze. |
| Rules of the game             | \- Pacman has two lives.<br /> - Pacman can eat the yellow dots spread all around the maze.<br /> - There are 4 Ghosts patrolling the maze. They can eat the Pacman when they see and catch it.<br /> - There are five power pellets kept in the maze. When the packman eats them, all the ghosts turn pale and they can be eaten by the packman.<br /> - Ghosts can be reborn after they are eaten.<br /> - Game is won when the packman eats all the yellow dots in the maze.<br /> - Game is lost when Pacman loses both its lives. |
| Balanced Game                 | 4 monsters patrolling vs Power pellets through which Pacman can eat the ghosts. Maze corners in which Pacman can hide |
| Adaptivity                    | It gets harder to eat the dots as the game progresses because there are lesser dots and they are spread across. |
| Chance vs Skill               | The movements of ghosts are completely random. So whether the Pacman gets detected by the ghost has elements of chance involved. The skill of player is in quickly maneuvering the Pacman away from the ghosts and eating all the yellow dots on the way. |
| Feedback                      | \- Player gets points depending on the dots/ghosts they eat.<br /> - Player loses life when eaten by the ghost.<br /> - Sounds in the game also give quick feedback to the player. |
| Story                         | Some games tell a story made by the game designers. Other games allow the player to infer a story through gameplay. What do you think is the story in Pacman? Why is the yellow Packman trying to eat all the dots? Who are these ghosts/monsters? Why are they after packman? |
